## About Me

#### My 10+ years working in various analyst roles, has been fueled by my passion for problem-solving, creating narratives with data and turning challenges into opportunities.  Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve seen the value of analyzing large data sets to uncover critical insights, identifying patterns and trends to drive business success, and offering solutions to address business needs, which inspired me to pursue further education to refine my skills in data collection, cleaning and manipulation and to learn new data analytics techniques and skills.
#### Iâ€™m a problem-solver, always seeking to enhance critical decision-making and business processes, actively seeking new opportunities and open to collaborating on exciting projects. 
#### In my personal life, I love unwinding and spending time at home with family.  Time is short and every moment is such a precious gift!
